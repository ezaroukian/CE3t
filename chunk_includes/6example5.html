		Here the rule is unchanged, but the diagram is no longer consistent with it.
	</p>
	
	<!--
	<p>
		It's still true that when <span class="q">P1 = Mary</span> and <span class="q">B1 = Moby-Dick</span>, <span class="q">P1</span> has the name <span class="q">Mary</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, when <span class="q">P1 = John</span> and <span class="q">B1 = War and Peace</span>, <span class="q">P1</span> has the name <span class="q">John</span>, not <span class="q">Mary</span>. The diagram, therefore, is not consistent with the rule.
	</p>
	-->
	
<p>
 Again, to determine if the diagram is consistent with this rule, we need to find the cases in the diagram where the 'if'-clause is true, then check whether the 'then'-clause is true.
 </p>
 <ul>
	<li>
		IF: The 'if'-clause is true when
		<ol>
			<li><span class='q'>P1=John</span> and <span class='q'>B1=War and Peace</span> (<span class='q'>the person John reads the book War and Peace</span>), and when 
			</li>
			<li><span class='q'>P1=Mary</span> and <span class='q'>B1=Moby-Dick</span> (<span class='q'>the person Mary reads the book Moby-Dick</span>)
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		THEN:
		<ol>
			<li>When <span class='q'>P1=John</span> and <span class='q'>B1=War and Peace</span>, the 'then'-clause (<span class='q'>the person John has as name Mary</span>) is FALSE 
			</li>
			<li>When <span class='q'>P1=Mary</span> and <span class='q'>B1=Moby-Dick</span>, the 'then'-clause (<span class='q'>the person Mary has as name Mary</span>) is true 
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
 </ul>

 <p>
	The diagram is therefore NOT consistent with the rule.
