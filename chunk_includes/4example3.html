<p>
Rules can also contain <b>variables</b>.
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;" >
	<li stype="margin-bottom: 15px;">
	We will use the variables <span class='q'>P1</span> and <span class='q'>P2</span> to vary over the people <span class='q'>John</span>, <span class='q'>Mary</span>, and <span class='q'>Peter</span>.<br/>
	</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>
	We will use the variables <span class='q'>B1</span> and <span class='q'>B2</span> to vary over the books <span class='q'>War and Peace</span>, <span class='q'>Middlemarch</span>, and <span class='q'>Moby-Dick</span>.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Here the rule is: <span class='q'>if (the person P1 has as name Peter) then (the person P1 reads the book War and Peace).</span>
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Remember that <span class='q'>P1</span> can be any of the people <span class='q'>John</span>, <span class='q'>Mary</span>, and <span class='q'>Peter</span>.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 To determine if the diagram is consistent with this rule, we need to find the cases in the diagram where the 'if'-clause is true, then check whether the 'then'-clause is true.
 </p>
 <ul>
	<li>
	IF: The 'if'-clause is true when <span class='q'>P1=Peter</span> (<span class='q'>the person Peter has as name Peter</span>)
	</li>
	<li>
	THEN: When <span class='q'>P1=Peter</span>, the 'then'-clause (<span class='q'>the person Peter reads the book War and Peace</span>) is true 
	</li>
 </ul>
 
 

<p>
	The diagram is therefore consistent with the rule.
