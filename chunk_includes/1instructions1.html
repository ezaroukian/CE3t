  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
In this task, you will see a rule and a diagram, and you will be asked whether the diagram is consistent with the rule.
</p>
<p>
The diagrams each show three different people (John, Mary, and Peter) and
three different books (War and Peace, Middlemarch, and Moby-Dick).
In addition, there are arrows pointing from a person to a book, indicating who reads what book.
</p>
<p>
On the following screens, you will see some examples.

<p>
Note that the wording and formatting in these rules may be a little unusual. Just do your best to interpret them.
