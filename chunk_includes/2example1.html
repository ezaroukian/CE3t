<div style="width: 40em;">
  
<p>
  In the example below, the rule states: <span class='q'>the person Mary reads the book Moby-Dick.</span> 
</p>
<p>
	In the diagram, we see an arrow connecting  <span class='q'>Mary</span> to <span class='q'>Moby-Dick</span>, indicating that she does indeed read this book. 
</p>
<p>
	We should therefore respond "Yes", the diagram is consistent with the rule.
