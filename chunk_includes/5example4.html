<div style="width: 40em;">


<p>
  Here the rule is: <span class='q'>if (the person P1 reads the book B1) then (the person P1 has as name Mary).</span>
 </p>


 <p>
 Again, to determine if the diagram is consistent with this rule, we need to find the cases in the diagram where the 'if'-clause is true, then check whether the 'then'-clause is true.
 </p>
 <ul>
	<li>
	IF: The 'if'-clause is true when <span class='q'>P1=Mary</span> and <span class='q'>B1=Moby-Dick</span> (<span class='q'>the person Mary reads the book Moby Dick</span>)
	</li>
	<li>
	THEN: When <span class='q'>P1=Mary</span> and <span class='q'>B1=Moby-Dick</span>, the 'then'-clause (<span class='q'>the person Mary has as name Mary</span>) is true 
	</li>
 </ul>

<p>
	The diagram is therefore consistent with the rule.
